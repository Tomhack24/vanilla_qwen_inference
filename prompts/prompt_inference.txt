# VQA Answer Generation Task: Creating Answers for Complex Reasoning Questions

## Task Overview
Generate concise answers for complex questions based on multimodal input (video + timestamps)

## Input Data
You will receive:
- **VQA Question**: A question that requires complex reasoning based on the video content. A file named `question_xxxx.txt`(where xxx is an integer)
- **Timestamp**: A list of [start, end] times in seconds that represent the video segments. A file named `time_xxx.txt` (where xxx is an integer)

## Answer Requirements
- **Conciseness**: â‰¤10 words
- **Accuracy**: Logically inferred from evidence, not speculative
- **Precision**: Direct and correct based on the input information

For each question, use exactly this format:
```
A: <your answer>
[[start1, end1], [start2, end2], [start3, end3]]
```

### Critical Timestamp Rules
- **Evidence Justification**: The timestamps in the final line represent the **evidence** used to derive the answer
- **Exact Reuse Only**: Use only the original [start, end] values provided in the input - do not create, modify, or merge timestamps
- **Multiple Selection**: Include all relevant timestamps that justify your answer

## Generation Instructions
1. **Generate answers** that are following the Answer Requirements above
2. **Select appropriate timestamps** that justify each answer

Generate your answers and select appropriate timestamps following the exact Output Format above.
